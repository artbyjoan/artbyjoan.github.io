			<h5>Exit Slip - What I Learned </h5>
			<h4 class="dark">Keywords: Formative Assessment, Checking for Understanding, Choice in Assessment, Knowledge Share, Student Ownership of Classroom, Student Ownership of Learning, Positive Reinforcement, Motivation by Reward  </h4>
			<p><h4><div class="small4">Purpose: To check for student's understanding of the content matter and the topics discussed in class <br> Application: After 3 days of scratchboard lessons students were asked to share one thing they know about scratchboard. Students were provided with a small piece of paper that was designed like a tweet. Students had an option of checking the 'private' box if they didn't want their knowledge to be shared with the rest of the class. Students were given 2 minutes before the bell to complete their exit slip. <br>
			Results: Students shared what they recollected from the lecture as well as what they learned on their own by experimenting with the materials first hand. The following day students were excited to see that their tweet became part of the classroom knolwedge wall. Students were eager to read what others have written and were learning from their peers without realizing it.

Students worked as a group to raise 2-3 critial questions to help strengthen the statement. Students traded the posterboard with their neighboring group. Students then were asked to construct a stronger statement using the provided artistic vocabulary word bank and the critical questions from their neighboring group. (You Do) After the group activity students were paired up to write about their partner's completed project. Students were asked to show strong statements using artistic vocabulary. <br>
			Results: Throughout the lesson students encountered many opportunities to practice questioning and strengthening statements. By the end of the lesson students were confidentally and skillfully writing artistic feedback for their peers. EL students were able to meet learning goals for this lesson.
