Students worked on color mixing and color matching to complete a class painting. Students chose a masterpainter and conducted research on them and made a replication of the master painting using acrylics paint. <br>Planning Stage: Students conducted a research on masterpainter of their interest and brought in a reference image to work from. <br>Main Project: Students created their version of the master painting using the techniques they learned during the intro lesson. <br>Reflection: Students spent 1-2 minutes at the end of the project sharing what they learned about their masterpainter during their research and showcased their masterpiece.

Students wrote their proposal explaining why their topic was meaningful to them. <br>Main Project: Students used Photoshop and Illustrator to create their design assets for their website and then used dreamweaver to develop their page.<br>
		 Assessment and Reflection: Students explained which software they used for each section of their project, displaying their knowledge of the software.

			<p><h4><div class="small4">Purpose: To check for student's understanding of the content matter and the topics discussed in class <br> Application: After 3 days of scratchboard lessons students were asked to share one thing they know about scratchboard. Students were provided with a small piece of paper that was designed like a tweet. Students had an option of checking the 'private' box if they didn't want their knowledge to be shared with the rest of the class. Students were given 3 minutes before the bell to complete their exit slip. <br>
			Results: Students shared what they recollected from the lecture as well as what they learned on their own by experimenting with the materials first hand. The following day students were excited to see that their tweet became part of the classroom knolwedge wall. Students were eager to read what others have written and were learning from their peers without realizing it.

			<p><h4><div class="small5">Purpose: Help students recognize weak statements, see components that makes the statement weak and construct a stronger statement using artistic vocabulary provided in a form of word bank.<br>
			 Application: (I Do) Students were presented with a sample image and a weak statement. With guided questions from the teacher, students participated in a class discussion where they successfully raised several questions to help strengthen the statement. (We Do) Students then were placed in groups of 3-4. Each group received posterboard with a unique image and a weak statement describing the image. Students worked as a group to raise 2-3 critial questions to help strengthen the statement. Students traded the posterboard with their neighboring group. Students then were asked to construct a stronger statement using the provided artistic vocabulary word bank and the critical questions from their neighboring group. (You Do) After the group activity students were paired up to write about their partner's completed project. Students were asked to show strong statements using artistic vocabulary. <br>
			Results: Throughout the lesson students encountered many opportunities to practice questioning and strengthening statements. By the end of the lesson students were confidentally and skillfully writing artistic feedback for their peers. EL students were able to meet learning goals for this lesson. They benefitted from the visual-aid, various modeling from their peers, repetition and the word bank.
